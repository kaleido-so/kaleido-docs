## Basics

This is the page where you configure the sources of user feedback. They can all work together.

### Sources

- `Manual addition`: Any feedback or idea can be added manually.

- `CSV file`: If you have a lot of feedback gathered.

- `Feedback form`: Share a form with your users so they can leave feedback directly.

- `Slack`: Send messages from your Slack channel to Kaleido.

- `Telegram`: Send messages from your Telegram chat to Kaleido.

### Rules

Configure what happens to incoming feedback automatically when it arrives:

- `Auto-fill`: When you add a user email to new feedback, Kaleido will search for previous feedback 
with the same email and automatically populate all the user data from that feedback into the new one.

- `Suggest projects`: When you add new feedback, Kaleido's AI will attempt to identify the relevant request 
to which the feedback should be directed. If no existing requests are detected, Kaleido will create a new one.
