All the feedback is connected to requests automatically; however, 
you can change these connections by simply dragging and dropping feedback onto the requests you think suit better.

When you're ready and sure that all the feedback is connected to requests properly, you can delve into the 
requests to find all the related data and specifications, ready for you.
