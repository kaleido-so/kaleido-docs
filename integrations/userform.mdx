## Basics

This is the page where you can set up your high-level strategy for the user requests that Kaleido has built 
based on user feedback. Every request is automatically placed on the timeline when it's created in your workspace.

</Frame>

You can change the position of the request, its durability, progress, and more. 
To have more control over the request timeline, dive into the request and adjust the values in this section:
