## Basics

Using our CSV import functionality, you can upload up to 1000 pieces of feedback at once to your Kaleido workspace. Additionally, you can include any extra information with the feedback, and all the additional data will be uploaded as well.

### Prepare your workspace

If you need to upload additional data to your workspace, create user fields that you will use to map to the CSV columns.

### Upload your CSV file

- Choose the file containing your user feedback and select the header row. 
By default, this will always be the top row of your file.

- Map the columns. Set up the fields you created earlier so that the values from specific CSV columns will be populated there.

- Verify the data. Confirm the rows that will be uploaded to your workspace.

After the process is complete, all the data from the file will transfer to your Kaleido workspace.
